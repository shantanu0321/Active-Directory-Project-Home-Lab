# 📌Active Directory Project Home Lab

I have made this project as a hands-on Active Directory (AD) Home Lab to learn about IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, and network management in a practical way. By setting up a small-scale enterprise environment at home using virtual machines. The lab includes a Windows Server as a Domain Controller, a Windows 10 workstation, an Ubuntu server running Splunk, and a Kali Linux machine to simulate attacks—all within a safe, controlled setting.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To gained experience in managing users and groups with Active Directory, monitoring logs with Splunk, and understanding how different cyber attacks are carried out and detected.

## 🖥️ Machines

- **Active Directory Domain Controller:** Windows Server
- **SIEM:** Ubuntu Server (Splunk)
- **Target:** Windows 10 (domain-joined)
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

1. Deploy Windows Server, promote to Domain Controller.
2. Join Windows 10 to the domain.
3. Install Splunk on Ubuntu, configure log forwarding.
4. Use Kali Linux for attack simulations.
